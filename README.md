## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project has pushed me to learn how drop down navigation links work. I learnt a lot about positioning (using relative,absolute interchangeably) and learnt using new JavaScript methods such as .match() and .closest() and target data attributes. I also used CSS Grid to help positioning and sizing my elements more effectively.

### Continued development

I will need to get better at laying out my elements, as well as further improving my skills in transform and creating dropdown menus.

### Useful resources

- [Webdev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified) - This helped me for the dropdown menu, it gave me a starting point to code out the dropdown menu.
